# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 repository! ðŸŽ„ This repository contains my solutions to the daily coding challenges provided by [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

## About

Advent of Code is an annual event featuring a series of coding challenges released daily from December 1st to 25th. These challenges help improve problem-solving and algorithmic thinking while spreading holiday cheer!

In this repository, I've committed to solving **all 25 days** of challenges using **JavaScript**. JavaScript is a versatile language with extensive community support, making it an excellent choice for tackling both simple and complex puzzles.

I aim to showcase creative and efficient solutions while leveraging JavaScript's strengths.
